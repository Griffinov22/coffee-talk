          Thank you for visiting my website about coffee and the amazing new
          drinks/terms that involve the beans that go into our favorite drinks.
          As of creating this website, I hope to achieve my dream of one day
          being able to have a coffee business of my own where I can bring
          together my passion for programming and making coffee. This website
          was made purely from my knowledge of coffee and will continue to add
          more drinks/terms as they become a trend. Feel free to come back to
          this site to catch up and reference, so you too can be a coffee
          officianado!

          Espresso is made by pressing steaming hot water through finely grinded
          coffee. Ideally, you shoot for a 2:1 ratio of coffee to water for
          espresso. The typical weight measurement is in grams. Espresso is the
          base for many drinks inlcuding the latte. Caffeine content is for
          espresso is not a one size fits all. Blonde roasts typically have the
          most caffeine per coffee bean for all varieties.

          A latte is a combination of any milk and espresso served in any type
          of cup. Depending on the size of the drink, the latte might get more
          or less 'shots' of espresso. A standard 12-ounce latte should get
          around two shots of espresso. After the shots are pulled, the barista
          will steam his/her milk and pour on top of the espresso.
